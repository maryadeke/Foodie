Hi, buddy!
1: your works is really messed up, in the structuring, i had created the Assets folder where all the images and other will go.
==================================================
2: your website i haven't yet understood its use/purpose thats why am not on track
---------
*HOW*
---------
=> everything is not organised it will cause confusing.
=> also try to create folders for the diff food types which i think you'll need to add more pages in the food like you create a folder for matooke which will included related pages to matooke, if its diffcult you can generate it dynamically  which is best practice

====================================
also use index.html not home 
====================================
and also in your js code ensure that you store the data of the user the popup (local storage)







======================================
Oba you need to keep it simple?
if so ignore the above ques but not folder structuring cause you might lose marks  :( 

    GOOD LUCK ADDING THE PAYMENT GATEWAY hahahahahahahahahah
